## WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS CODE 

- missed on writing a important line [  placeholder="ENTER A TASK" ]

- did some mistake in syntax



 ## EXPLATION OF CODE 


-a)  function TodoApp()     :     defines a React component named TodoApp.



-b) const [task, setTask] = useState("");    :   creates a state variable called task (initially empty). setTask updates this variable.



-c)const [list, setList] = useState([]);     :     creates a state variable called list (initially an empty array). setList updates this list.
